# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

Now a days every one know about increasing the rate of road accident . Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep .The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras . which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy . It also Help to alert the passenger to know either driver is sleeping or not .
# Motivation
Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving .The objective of this Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

# Future-Prospects
The model can be improved incrementally by using other parameters like blink rate, yawning, state of the car, etc. If all these parameters are used it can improve the accuracy by a lot.
We plan to further work on the project by adding a sensor to track the heart rate in order to prevent accidents caused due to sudden heart attacks to drivers.
Same model and techniques can be used for various other uses like Netflix and other streaming services can detect when the user is asleep and stop the video accordingly. It can also be used in application that prevents user from sleeping.
